# NFL Football Analysis Application
## Project description

The Football Analysis Application is designed to help coaches, analysts, and players get detailed insights into football matches. With our application, you can visualize player movements, track speed and acceleration, and analyze how close players are to each other on the field.

Our user-friendly interface makes it easy to filter and customize your analysis to focus on what matters most. We built this tool using principles of user-centered and interaction design to ensure it’s not only powerful but also intuitive and easy to use.

Whether you’re looking to improve team strategies, study player performance, or just get a deeper understanding of the game, our Football Analysis Software provides the tools you need.
